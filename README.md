## Introduction

The **Demo Flutter App DevOps** repository demonstrates how to implement best practices in DevOps to manage and automate the development, testing, and deployment of a Flutter mobile application. It includes configurations for CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and automation scripts, enabling the team to collaborate effectively and deliver high-quality software.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Flutter SDK
- Git
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- CI/CD Tool (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD)

## Features

- CI/CD pipelines for automatic building, testing, and deployment of the Flutter app.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for setting up cloud resources.
- Docker containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- Automated testing and code quality checks.
- Integration with version control system (Git) for code management.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevBarham/demo-flutter-app-devops.git
cd demo-flutter-app-devops
```

2. Install Flutter SDK and necessary dependencies.

3. Run the application locally:

```bash
flutter run
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The repository is pre-configured with CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process. The pipelines can be set up using your preferred CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD) by configuring the required environment variables, secrets, and pipeline triggers.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the repository is organized as follows:

```
demo-flutter-app-devops/
